== Flags

|===
|Flag |Meaning | Aciton |Operands

|Negative | MSB = 1 | N = 1 | signed
|Zero | Result = 0 | Z = 1 | signed, unsigned
| Carry | Carry | C = 1 | unsigned
| Overflow | Overflow | V = 1 | signed

== Arithmetic Operations

|=== 
| Bitwise operations | Shift / Rotate

== Unsigned / Signed Integers

=== Addition / Subtraction

Unsigned:: 
* *Addition*: C = 1 -> Carry. Result too large for available bits
* *Subtraction*: C = 0 -> Borrow. Result less than Zero (no negative numbers) 
Signed:: 
* *Addition*: potential *overflow* with equally signed operands
* *Subtraction*: potential *overlfow* with oppositely signed operands

* Type
** *Unconditional*: jump always
** *Conditional*: jump only if condition is met
* Address hand-over
** *Direct*: target address part of instruction
** *Indirect*: target address in register
* Address of target
** *Relative*: target address relative to PC
** *Absolute*: absolute target address
